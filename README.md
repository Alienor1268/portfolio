# portfolio

This portfolio includes my various researches and studies on many themes, mainly related to nature. The part programmed in R is the most important, it is the programming language I practice the most, so that's why the works are more advanced.
This portfolio gathers what is possible for a beginner in computer programming. The portfolio shows what skills I have acquired over time. As I started my studies 2 years ago, I am very proud to show what has been accomplished so far
